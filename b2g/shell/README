Braille Wizard Shell
====================

To build
--------

1. Download and set up an [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2. Create an Android Virtual Device running Android 2.2 or greater.
3. Set up the Simple Build Tool as per [these instructions](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html).
4. With the emulator running, type the following from the source directory:

sbt update android:install-emulator

Replace "install-emulator" with "install-device" if installing onto actual hardware.
to compile use:
sbt android:package-debug

To run the shell, press the _Home_ key, then select "Shell," optionally making it your default (though this isn't recommended until more functionality is developed.)

also, 
sbt update       ; fixed some problems
