* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.6 (2016-3-7)

** New features
- The YAML tests now allow for an optional test description. See the
  documentation for more details.
** Bug fixes
** Other changes
** Braille table improvements
** Backwards incompatible changes
- The json based harness test suite has been removed as its
  functionality has been superceded by the YAML tests. Please use
  these from now on.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.5 (2015-12-1)
This minor release introduces new tables (Mongolian and Norwegian 8
dot) and new features to the tracing tool. But the most exiting news
about this release is probably the fact that 12 developers have
contributed to it, showing how widely used liblouis is and how
actively the development progresses.

** New features
- A DEF file is now generated automatically for the windows builds.
  Thanks to Christian Egli
- lou_trace supports backtranslation now. Thanks to Bert Frees

** Bug fixes
- Fix a bug in the findtable code. Thanks to Michael Katzmann for the
  report.
- Fix some compile time warnings on Windows, thanks to Bue
  Vester-Andersen.
- Fixes to the logging code by Arend Arends.

** Other changes
- Add test data for EUB symbols, thanks to Paul Wood
- Clean up dead code i.e. remove support for (undocumented) nobreak
  opcode. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.

** Braille table improvements
- New Mongolian table thanks to Tsengel Maidar and Sreeja Param.
- Improvements to the Chinese braille table thanks to Coscell Kao.
- Massive improvements to Norwegian, thanks to Lars Bjørndal, Ammar
  Usama and Jostein Austvik Jacobsen. They added a 8 dot table and
  lots of test data.
- Improvements to Hungarian, thanks to Attila Hammer

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.4 (2015-08-31)
This is a minor release in terms of features. But in terms of test
coverage and stability it is a vast improvement over previous versions
of Liblouis. The new YAML based test suite contains more than a
million of validated translations. Every change in Liblouis is tested
against this corpus ensuring the change doesn't break anything.

** New features
- YAML based harness tests. Harness tests can now be written in simple
  YAML notation and they are integrated with the normal `make check`
  command. They can be used for both ucs2 and ucs4 and no Python is
  required. Thanks to Christian Egli.

** Bug fixes
- Use a separate gnulib instance for the library and the tools. Use
  the strndup module to avoid build problems on windows.
- Fix a problem with the nocross opcode when used in combination with
  the opcodes nocont and compbrl, thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Fix a problem with the decoding of the harness test files. Thanks to
  Bert Frees.
- Fix numerous problems in the way braille indicators are handled.
  There is now a safe version of the checkAttr function which makes
  sure that no attributes are checked beyond the boundaries of the
  currentInput. This fixes the random behavior with tests where the
  emphasis extends to the end of the input string. Thanks to Christian
  Egli.

** Other changes
- if found use texi2any to build the documentation, thanks to Martin
  Michlmayr.
- Fix permissions of Korean tables, thanks to Peter Lundblad.
- Update the windows build instructions, thanks to Bue
  Vester-Andersen.

** Braille table improvements
- Improvements to Hungarian, thanks to Attila Hammer
- Improvements to Hungarian 8 dot and Serbian grade 1, thanks to
  Zvonimir Stanecic

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.3 (2015-06-01)
Given the release number you might think this is only a minor release.
However looking at the number of developers who contributed to it and
the number of pull requests and issues that were solved this turns out
to be a very impressive and solid release. Most prominently we have a
new function to discover tables based on meta data in table headers.
Also makeinfo is no longer required to build liblouis. And lastly we
have numerous improvements in Braille tables such as Korean,
Vietnamese and UEB to name just a few.

** New features
- [beta] The new function lou_findTable can be used for table
  discovery based on meta data in table headers. Thanks to Bert Frees.
- The Python API now has a new function to check tables aptly named
  ~checkTable~. Thanks to Davy Kager.

** Bug fixes
- Fixed a problem in resolveTable when using a Java resolver, thanks
  to Bert Frees

** Other changes
- The build dependency on makeinfo is now optional. If it is not
  installed we simply do not build the documentation.

** Braille table improvements
- Improvements to Bengali, Devanagari, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam,
  Telugu and Oriya, thanks to Sreeja Param
- Corrections and improvements made to en-GB tables thanks to Paul
  Wood
- Vast restructuring to Korean tables. In 2006 the Institute for Korean
  Braille modified some dots in Korean Braille. Specifically, some
  punctuation dots are now based on English. To accommodate this change
  and to retain the old tables, the Korean table set was revised as
  follows:
  - Added three files: ko-chars, the Korean characters dictionary, and
    rules for g1 and g2.
  - ko-g1 and ko-g2 are now interface files that includes needed
    files.
  - Added three files for Korean Braille 2006 revision along with a
    test harness.
- New table for Polish 8 dot computer braille. Thanks to Karol Pecyna.
- New table for Vietnamese 6 dot. Thanks to Harri Pasanen.
- Corrections and improvements made to UEB tables thanks to Paul Wood
  - Typeform passage indicators
  - Degree sign
  - Dash signs
  - Math signs
  - Accent modifiers
  - Accented letters

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.2 (2015-03-02)
This release, which was mostly pushed out the door by Bert and Mesar,
fixes a long standing emphasis bug, adds more functionality to the
harness test suite and improves, as usual, on Braille tables. Notably
there is a brand new finish table backed by Celia.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.0 (2014-09-01)
This is the first release by the new maintainer team. A lot of work by
people from across the community contributed to this release. There
are massive additions and updates to the Braille tables (e.g.
Afrikaans, Hebrew, many Indian languages, Korean) and also changes to
the C API to enable call backs for error messages and warnings.

** New features
*** New Braille tables
- Tables for Afrikaans, Cherokee, Hawaiian, Maori, Sotho and Tswana
  were donated by Greg Kearney. Afrikaans, Cherokee, Maori and Hawaiian
  all are grade 1 tables and with the exception of Cherokee were
  derived from World Braille Usage 2013. The Cherokee was taken from
  the specification published at www.cbtbc.org/cherokee/.
*** Logging callback
There is now a callback system in place to get error messages and
warnings. This can be used from programs that use liblouis to log
warnings for example.

** Bug fixes
- fix back translation problems when word gets split in unusual places
  causing back translation of whole words for example K5 back
  translates to Knowledgeen, M>k back translates to Moreark, and M5
  back translates to Moren.  This caused over 8400 extra back
  translation errors in en-us-g2 and 5000 in en-ueb-g2. Thanks to Ken
  Perry.
- Fixed bug to prevent removal of \xffff between largesign rules. This
  solves a Liblouisutdml bug where \xffff is used as a segment
  delimiter.
- Fixed a bug in back translation, when a letsign was encountered, the
  letsign was being applied beyond the element it applied to.
- Fix memory leaks in the default table resolver introduced in the
  previous release.
- Fixes to the build system by Simon Aittamaa

** Braille table improvements
- Major improvements to Indian tables thanks to the Indian National
  Institute for Visually Handicapped, in particular Dipendra Manocha,
  Mesar Hameed, Dinesh Kaushall and Sreeja Parameswaran:
  - Corrected opcodes for letters, punctuation marks, digits, signs
    etc.
  - Updated braille codes according to prescribed braille codes for
    each Unicode character by the Braille Council of India for all
    Indian languages.
  - defined rules for dealing with Nukhta character in Hindi table
  - defined rule to insert dot-1 between consonant followed by full
    vowel character in all Indian Languages
  - defined rules for shifting of halant character before the
    consonant. This character is placed after the consonant in normal
    typing but need to be before the consonant in braille. This rule
    is applicable for all Indian languages.
  - defined rules for two conjunct characters "ksha and gya" used in
    all Indian Languages for which there are specific codes in
    Braille.
- New Hebrew table that is based on the new unified Hebrew Braille
  code standard that was put together on January 2014 after a
  conference with all of the specialists in this field in Israel. It
  includes improved representation of Hebrew letters, special letters
  that are called Nikud, and punctuation symbols. The old Braille
  standard is not relevant any more. Thanks to Adi Kushnir.
- UEB table fixes: Fix ity contraction, fixed the missing end word
  contraction ;n ;d sign 46. thanks to Ken Perry.
- Fix for Norwegian where letsign is affecting some extra characters
  thanks to Lars Bjørndal
- Much improved hyphenation for Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal

  braille.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.4 (2014-03-03)
This release contains nine months worth of braille table improvements
for example for Danish, UEB, en-us, Nemeth, Bulgarian, Slovenian and
many more. Also there are fixes to the core for table path resolving
and back-translation.

** New features
   - Added function lou_registerTableResolver for plugging in a table
     resolver callback from your host language.

** Bug fixes
   - Fixed ENDSEGMENT indicator in computer Braille thanks to John
     Boyer.
   - Emphasized words should now be contracted consistently thanks to
     John Boyer.
   - Fixed several problems with back-translation. A slash within a
     number and strings such as 5-inch-diameter and 25-year-old-man
     should now back-translate correctly. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fixed a problem with syllable opcode. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2. Thanks to Peter Lundblad.
   - When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path, the
     "includes" in that table will now work as expected, meaning files
     in the same directory will be found.

** Braille table improvements
   - fr-bfu-comp8.utb: corrections, zero was wrongly displayed in some

   - Fix for the lich sign in the German tables. Thanks to Halim
     Sahin.
   - Nemeth improvements thanks to John Boyer.
     - Spaces in nemethdefs.cti were changed to unbreakable spaces.
       This was done so that Nemeth expressions would not be broken

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.3 (2013-06-21)
** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Korean grade 1 and grade 2 thanks to Joseph Lee
    - U.K. English 8 dot computer braille table thanks to David

    In tests/harness, one can do make <filename> or make runall
    Removed from make check because these checks are checking the validity
    of our tables, rather than validity of the code.

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation
     table.
   - Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace statements,
     if you need to compress whitespace, consider adding compress.ctb
     to the list of tables when processing.
   - Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 1 and 2),
     thanks to Joseph Lee
   - Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots Braille

   - Fix several buffer over/under runs in
     lou_translateString.c:hyphenate.
   - Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix inputPositions calculation for the
     case where the equals sign is used as the dots operand. Thanks to
     Bert Frees
   - Fix a bug when resizing a table. Previously not all references to
     this table were updated.

** Backwards incompatible changes
   - The feature that allowed a mapping between language code and
     Braille table was removed as it contained a out-of-bounds access
     bug, was never documented and probably never used. Thanks to
     Peter Nilsson Lundblad and Jeremy Roman for analyzing this
     problem and providing a patch.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.2 (2012-12-18)

While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other
new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

** New features
*** New tool to trace rule application
    There is a new tool (lou_trace) which helps to trace which rules
    have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful
    for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more
    information.
*** New Braille tables
    - Inuktitut grade 1, thanks to Greg Kearney.
    - UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace
      the old UEB tables (UEBC-g1.utb and UEBC-g2.ctb).
    - Korean table thanks to Joseph Lee

  definitions. Thanks to Simone Dal Maso <simone.dalmaso@juvox.it>.
- Rename it-it-g1.utb to it-it-comp6.utb and it-it-g1.utb2 to
  it-it-comp8.utb.

** Bug fixes
- Fix outputPos and inlen where an input character generates multiple
  output characters.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.0 (2012-9-10)

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

NOTE: If you have private tables you might want to migrate them to
utf-8. To do this just use iconv as follows:

  $ iconv -f latin-1 -t utf-8 <input >output

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
    - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** UTF-8 support in tables
    Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
    nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
    3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
    system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
    Mesar Hameed.
*** Add a test harness generator
    A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
    formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
    of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
    for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
    file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
    the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
*** Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings
    The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    Thanks to Michael Whapples.

** Improved C-based test framework
   - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
     involving Unicode.
   - Added numerous tests, e.g. for lowercase and Unicode, for the
     input position, for repeated, etc.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
   - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
   - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
     characters
   - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
   - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
     are involved
   - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
     opcodes when dealing with Unicode
   - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
     bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
     Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
   - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
     chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
   - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

** Braille Table Improvements
   - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
   - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
     duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
     six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
     included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
   - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
   - hu1.ctb renamed to hu-hu-g1.ctb
   - hu.ctb renamed to hu-hu-comp8.ctb

    paths (separated by commas) where liblouis should look for tables.
    This allows the user to keep local tables.
*** New --quiet option for lou_checktable
    lou_checktable writes to stderr even in the case of success. This

   - Fixed problems with the Marburg maths table for mathematics and
     the UK maths table for mathematics

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.1.0 (2010-8-19)

** New features
*** New tables
    - Added tables for Portuguese grade 1 and 2
    - Added unicode.dis for Unicode braille
*** Modified tables
    - Updated Danish tables
*** Implemented language to table mapping
*** New format of error messages
    The error messages are now reported in a format similar to the one
    used in gcc. 
*** New opcode
    - added undefined opcode
*** Python bindings
    - Allow the user to configure the maximum output length by
      specifying a number by which the input length is multiplied
      using the outlenMultiplier module variable. The default will
      handle the case where every input character is undefined in the
      translation table. Previously, this was hard-coded to 2, which
      was insufficient in some cases.
    - Add compbrlLeftCursor mode constant.
    - Add compileString function which wraps lou_compileString.
    - Corrections/clarifications to docstrings.
    - Add python binding for the lou_hyphenate function.
    - Added python wrapper for lou_backTranslateString and lou_backTranslate.

*** liblouisxslt as an example
    Add liblouisxslt as an example to python/examples. This is
    basically an extension of libxslt that lets you invoke liblouis
    from an xslt stylesheet to do Braille translation on text nodes
    for example. 
*** compbrlLeftCursor
    Added a patch provided by Volker Bijewitz to implement
    compbrlLeftCursor.

** Bug fixes
*** output cursorPos
    Fix the output cursorPos when the compbrlAtCursor mode is enabled
    and the characters around the cursor translate to multiple braille
    cells, such as in the Chinese braille tables.
*** outpos when doing back translation
    Include a patch by Timothy Lee to fix outpos when doing back translation
      (issue 11)
*** inputPos/outputPos for undefined characters
    Fix the input/output position arrays for characters in the input
      which are undefined in the translation table.
*** table fixes
    - Fixed a bug with back translation of '*n'. (issue 13)
    - Fixes to the en-us-g2.ctb table
*** Python bindings
    - Remove unnecessary imports, allowing the bindings to run in Python
      2.7. (issue 12)
    - lou_translate* writes output information in typeform, so
      allocate enough bytes for it. Fixes possible buffer overruns and
      resultant crashes.
*** Miscellaneous
    - Fixes to the man page generation to fix issues that were
      reported by the Debian packaging builder
    - Do not invoke help2man when cross-compiling 
    - Documentation updates (issue 10)
    - Removing noletsign defaults
