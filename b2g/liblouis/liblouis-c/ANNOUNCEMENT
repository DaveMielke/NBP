Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This minor release introduces new tables (Mongolian and Norwegian 8
dot) and new features to the tracing tool. But the most exiting news
about this release is probably the fact that 12 developers have
contributed to it, showing how widely used liblouis is and how
actively the development progresses.
