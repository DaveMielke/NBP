The best way to maintain the B2G is to keep it away from extreme conditions such as excessive dust or seasonal pollen that could impact the braille display. Use common sense to protect the B2G from extreme heat or cold conditions, and to have clean hands to minimize oil and food residue that can harm the braille display or keyboard.
