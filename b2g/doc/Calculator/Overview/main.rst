Overview
========

This calculator has been designed to be as usable as possible
not only by sighted people
but also by blind people using speech and/or a braille device.
It's easy to use via
it's own on-screen calculator-style keys,
a full on-screen keyboard,
or an externally-connected Bluetooth or USB keyboard.

It offers the following features:

* Real and complex decimal operations.
* Fixed, scientific, and engineering notation.
* Trigonometric functions that support radians, degrees, and gradians.
* Unit conversion.
* Integer and bitwise hexadecimal operations.
* Predefined variables for common scientific constants.
* Management of persistent user-defined variables.
