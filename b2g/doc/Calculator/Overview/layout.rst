Screen Layout
-------------

This subsection contains screen layout images
that've been intentionally drawn using traditional ASCII art.
This has been done so that a blind person can easily "look" at them
because screen readers are notoriously poor at dealing with graphical images.

In both portrait and landscape modes,
the `result line`_ is immediately above the `expression line`_
and the `Clear`_ button is immediately below it at the very left.
This is to make expression entry as easy as possible
for a blind person using a braille device.
Moving backward one position enables him/her to quickly check the result,
and moving forward one position allows him/her to easily clear the expression.
