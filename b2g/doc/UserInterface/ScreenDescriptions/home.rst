The Home Screen
---------------

To add a shortcut to the home screen:

1) Go to the home screen.
2) Click on ``Apps``.
3) Navigate to the label of the application that you'd like to add.
4) Press Space+Dot8+home (dots 123456).

To remove a shortcut from the home screen:

1) Go to the home screen.
2) Navigate to the label of the application that you'd like to remove.
3) Press Space+Dot7+home (dots 123456).

If you'd rather not search for the application's label then you can
find an empty line within any input area (see `Input Areas`_) and type it.
You only need to type enough characters to uniquely identify it
among all of the applications that are installed on your |product name|.
Letters can be in either lower or upper case,
and the characters don't need to be at the beginning or end of the label.

When you're finished typing, press the key combination for the shortcut action
that you'd like to perform (see above). If the characters match the labels of
more than one application then the list will be presented within a popup
(see `Popups`_).
If this happens then navigate to the one you'd like to add or remove,
and press Center.

The Standard Android Launcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The |user interface| is initially configured to use
the standard Android launcher for home screen management.
This, as is true for most Android capabilities, can be changed
but that's beyond the scope of this document.

The standard Android launcher allows you to organize your home screen
by dragging the shortcuts on it to new locations.
See `Dragging Screen Elements`_ for instructions on how to do this
via the |user interface|.

In addition to simply moving shortcuts around, it also allows you
to create folders so that shrotcuts can be organized into meaningful groups.
In order to launch an app that's within a folder,
you need to first click on the folder to open it,
and to then click on that app's shortcut within the opened folder.
Press Back to close an opened folder without launching an app within it.

In addition to the labels for the shrotcuts that it contains,
an opened folder also has an input area (see `Input Areas`_)
that contains its current name.
Editing the text within this area renames the folder.
A newly created folder has no name.

Folder-related operations include:

* Drag a shortcut on top of another one in order to
  create a folder that contains both of them.

* Drag a shortcut on top of a folder in order to add it to that folder.

* Drag a shortcut out of an opened folder.
