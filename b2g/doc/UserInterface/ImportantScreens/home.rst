The Home Screen
---------------

The home screen is the main Android screen from which apps are launched.
It's the screen that first comes up after Android has booted,
and you can always get back to it
either by pressing Space + Dots123456
or by pressing Down while holding Dot4.

The home screen is managed by a special kind of app known as a launcher.
The |product name| is initially configured to use
`The Standard Android Launcher`_.
This, as is true for most Android capabilities, can be changed
but that's beyond the scope of this document.

Adding and Removing Shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regardless of which launcher is being used,
the |user interface| supports the following home screen management operations:

* To add a shortcut to the home screen:

  1) Go to a list of all the apps currently installed on the |product name|.
     To do this via `The Standard Android Launcher`_:

     1) Go to the home screen.
     2) Open the ``Apps`` drawer (on the `favourites bar`_).

  2) Navigate to the app that you'd like to add.

  3) Press Space+Dot8+home (dots 123456).

* To remove a shortcut from the home screen:

  1) Go to the home screen.

  2) Navigate to the shortcut that you'd like to remove.

  3) Press Space+Dot7+home (dots 123456).

If you'd rather not search for the app then
find an empty line within any input area (see `Input Areas`_) and type it.
You only need to type enough characters to uniquely identify it
among all of the apps that are currently installed on the |product name|.
Letters can be in either lower or upper case,
and they don't need to be at the beginning or end of the name.

When you're finished typing, press the key combination
for the shortcut action that you'd like to perform (see above).
If the characters match more than one app
then the list will be presented within a popup (see `Popups`_).
If this happens then navigate to the one you'd like to add or remove,
and press Center.

The Standard Android Launcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard Android launcher allows you to switch between five home screens. 
Each of them has a `search area`_ at the left,
a `favourites bar`_ at the right,
and a large, `customizable area`_ in the middle.

The default home screen is the middle one [Home Screen 3].
Pressing Android's home key
(either Space + Dots123456 or pressing Down while holding Dot4)
when on any other home screen goes to this one.
In other words, pressing Android's home key twice
guarantees that you're on the default home screen.

.. _search area:

The search area (at the left), as it's rendered in braille,
has a ``Search`` icon at the very top
and a ``Voice Search`` icon at the very bottom.
On an actual screen,
there's an input area at the top that contains the text being searched for,
and the space between it and the ``Voice Search`` icon (at the bottom)
is where the search results appear.

.. _favourites bar:

The favourites bar (at the right) is
a vertically-oriented set of shortcuts and/or folders.
It also contains the ``Apps`` drawer which, when clicked,
brings up an alphabetically sorted list of all of the apps
that are currently installed on the device.
Up to two shortcuts and/or folders may be above the ``Apps`` drawer,
and up to two may be below it.
The favourites bar should contain your most frequently used apps because,
although it's customizable, it's the same on all of the home screens.

.. _customizable area:

The customizable area (in the middle) occupies most of each home screen.
A new shortcut is added to the customizable area of the home screen
nearest to the default one that isn't full.
When there's a choice, preference is given
to the home screen with the higher number.

In addition to `Adding and Removing Shortcuts`_,
you can also reorganize this area
by dragging the shortcuts within it to new locations.
See `Dragging Screen Elements`_ for instructions on how to do this
via the |user interface|.

A shortcut can also be dragged to, from, or along the `favourites bar`_.

Folders
```````

In addition to moving shortcuts around, you can also create folders
so that the shortcuts can be organized into meaningful groups.
In order to launch an app that's within a folder,
you need to first click on the folder to open it,
and to then click on that app's shortcut within the opened folder.
Press Back to close an opened folder without launching an app within it.

An opened folder also has an input area (see `Input Areas`_)
that contains its current name.
Editing the text within this area renames the folder.
A newly created folder has no name.

Folder-related operations include:

* Dragging a shortcut on top of another one
  creates a new folder that contains both of them.

* Dragging a shortcut on top of a folder adds it to that folder.

* Dragging a shortcut within an opened folder reorganizes that folder.

* Dragging a shortcut out of an opened folder removes it from that folder.

A folder can be dragged within the `customizable area`_,
as well as to, from, or along the `favourites bar`_.

A folder can only contain shortcuts - it can't contain a folder.
