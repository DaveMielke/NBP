The Clipboard
-------------

To copy text to the clipboard, press Space+Dot8+c (dots 14). If this is done
when not within an input area, or when within an input area with no selected
text, then all of the text is copied. If this is done within an input area with
selected text then just that text is copied.

To copy part of the text to the clipboard when not within an input area:

1) Move to a place where the first character is visible.

2) Hold Backward while pressing the cursor routing key behind the first
   character.

3) Move to a place where the last character is visible.

4) Hold Forward while pressing the cursor routing key behind the last
   character. The text from the first character through the last character
   (inclusive) will be copied to the clipboard. This step will fail if:

   * The first character hasn't been set.
   * The last character is before the first character.

Note that these same steps work somewhat differently within an input area (see
`Text Selection`_).

To cut text to the clipboard, press Space+Dot8+x (dots 1346). This can only be
done within an input area. If text hasn't been selected then all of the text is
cut. If text has been selected then just that text is cut.

To paste text from the clipboard, press Space+Dot8+v (dots 1236). This can only
be done within an input area. If text hasn't been selected then the pasted text
is inserted just to the left of the cursor. If text has been selected then the
pasted text replaces the selected text.
