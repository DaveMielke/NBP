Sliders
-------

A ``slider`` is a control that intuitively (from a visual perspective)
represents a numeric value (distance, magnitude, etc). It's often used, for
example, to represent a volume control, the current position within a song,
etc.

Each time the slider is adjusted, a brief message is displayed that 
announces its new position (as a percentage). Unfortunately, due to a 
current system limitation, its current position can't be determined (without
actually looking at it on the screen). It's necessary, therefore, to adjust its
position back and forth in order to figure out what it is.

Attempting to either increase a slider's position beyond its maximum or
decrease its position beyond its minimum neither displays a position message
nor indicates an error.

The Directional Keys When on a Slider
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A slider is normally adjusted by tapping the desired point along it's bar.
This, of course, can't be done on a device that doesn't have a touch screen.
Instead, use the Left and Right directional keys (on the D-Pad) to adjust it.

* The Left key decreases its position.
* The Right key increases its position.
* The Up and Down keys don't do anything.
