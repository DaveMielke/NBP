Emulating the Android Keys
--------------------------

All Android devices have a number of special keys.
There are two ways to emulate each of them:

* With two hands, by pressing Space together with a related letter or
  special symbol. While these may be easier to remember, they're also less
  convenient because both hands must be removed from the display.

* With one hand, by pressing Dot4 together with one of the D-Pad keys.

A braille-friendly version of the ``Apps`` drawer
(usually found on the `favourites bar`_ of `the home screen`_)
can be accessed by pressing Space+g (dots 1245).
