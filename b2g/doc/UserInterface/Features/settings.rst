The Settings Screen
-------------------

Pressing Space+o (dots 135) takes you to the Settings screen for the
|user interface|.

The top line contains the following buttons:

Save Settings
  Save the current settings for later restoration. This is a good way
  to checkpoint the configuration that you're most comfortable with.

Restore Settings
  Restore the settings that were most recently saved. This is how to get back
  to the configuration that you were most comfortable with.

Reset to Defaults
  Restore the settings to an internally-defined configuration. This is how to
  recover if, for example, you've accidentally messed up your saved settings.

System Maintenance
  Go to `The System Maintenance Screen`_.

Each subsequent line contains a setting that can be changed, and is laid out in
columns as follows:

1) This column contains the name of the setting.

2) For a boolean setting, this column contains an on/off switch.
   For any other kind of setting, it shows the setting's current value.

3) For numeric settings, this column contains a button that decreases its value.
   For settings that have discrete values, this column contains a Change button
   that brings up a dialog from which the desired value can be selected.

4) For numeric settings, this column contains a button that increases its value.
