Braille
-------

The On-screen Monitor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An on-screen monitor that shows what's on the braille display can be enabled
from the `Braille Settings`_ screen. It shows both the braille cells and the text.

Adjusting the Dot Firmness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The firmness of the braille dots can be adjusted from the `Braille Settings`_ screen.

Disabling the Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The braille display is enabled by default. It can be disabled by pressing
Backward+Dot1, and reenabled by pressing Forward+Dot4.
Either booting the |product name| or waking it up (see `The Power Switch`_)
also reenables it if `speech`_ is disabled.
Braille can't be disabled while `speech`_ is disabled.
