Build Details
-------------

There may be times when you need to identify the exact build of the
|user interface| that you're currently using. For example, this information is
particularly helpful when you're reporting a problem or checking if there's a
newer version.

You can get this information by pressing Space, Backward, and Forward
together. This will cause details that identify the build to be presented
within a screen that looks something like this::
