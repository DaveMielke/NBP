Braille-friendly Clock
----------------------

You can access a braille-friendly clock by pressing Space+t (dots 2345).
The date and time are displayed on the first line using the same format
currently configured for the Android clock except that it also includes seconds.
The second line contains the abbreviated week day and month names,
and the third line identifies the time zone.
For example::

  2012/02/29 10:26:53
  Wed, Feb 29
  EST (UTC-0500)

The four-digit number within (parentheses) on the third line
is the time zone's offset, in (two-digit) hours and (two-digit) minutes,
from UTC (Universal Coordinated Time).
The abbreviation EST (in this example) means Eastern Standard Time
(a North American time zone),
which is five hours earlier (hence the minus sign [-]) than UTC.
