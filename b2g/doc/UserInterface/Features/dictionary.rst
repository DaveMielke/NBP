Dictionary Definition
---------------------

you can request the definition for a (space-delimited) word
by pressing any cursor routing key behind that word while holding Dot5.
It's displayed within a pop-up (see `Pop-ups`_).
|uses internet|

If there's more than one definition for a word
then only the first one is displayed.
Requesting the definition of a word within a definition does work.

The default is to search all available dictionaries.
This behaviour can be changed,
e.g. a specific dictionary can be selected,
from the `Advanced Settings`_ screen.
