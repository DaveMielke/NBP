Ways to Learn
-------------

There are a number of ways to learn about the |user interface|
right on the |product name| itself:

Pressing Space+h (dots 125)
  This brings up an on-device copy of this document so you can read it off-line.
  It's a plain text version, though, so even internal links won't work.

Pressing Space+Dots78+h (dots 125)
  This brings up a web-resident copy of this document.
  It's an HTML version so all links (both internal and external) will work.
  There are, however, two potential problems with this method:

  * |uses internet|

  * Some web browsers are less accessible than others,
    and some aren't accessible at all.
    If the |user interface| tells you that there's a "web view"
    where you're expecting to find the content of a web page
    then you're using a non-accessible browser.
    As of the time that this is being written, we recommend
    that you use the |recommended web browser| browser.

Using an `Action Chooser`_
  * Press Space+Dot8+h (dots 125) for an action chooser
    offering all of the actions that don't involve a cursor routing key.

  * Hold Space while pressing a cursor routing key for an action chooser
    offering all of the actions that do involve a cursor routing key.

  Each line shows the name of an action,
  the key combination that performs it (when not within the chooser),
  and a summary of what it does.
  You can perform an action from within the chooser
  by pressing Center while on its line.

The Quick Start Guide is also available:

* Press Space+q (dots 12345) for an on-device, plain-text copy.
* Press Space+Dots78+q (dots 12345) for a web-resident copy.
