Ways to Learn
-------------

There are a number of ways to learn about the |user interface|
right on the |product name| itself.
Pressing Space+h (dots 125) presents a list of the available documents.
If one of the key combinations listed below is entered within
|partial entry timeout|
then immediately go to its corresponding document.
If not, then an `Action Chooser`_ is presented
that lets you select the desired document from a list.

Each of the documents is available in one or more of the following formats:

Plain Text
  A document in this format resides on the |product name| itself
  and, therefore, can be read off-line.
  Neither external nor internal links within it will work.

HTML
  A document in this format resides on the web.
  Both external and internal links within it will work.
  There are some factors to consider when Reading a document in this format:

  * |uses internet|

  * Some web browsers are less accessible than others,
    and some aren't accessible at all.
    If the |user interface| tells you that there's a "web view"
    where you're expecting to find the content of a web page
    then you're using a non-accessible browser.
    As of the time that this is being written, we recommend
    that you use the |recommended web browser| browser.
