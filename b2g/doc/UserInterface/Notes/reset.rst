Resetting the |product name|
----------------------------

If you ever need to reset the |product name|
then press Dots4568 (all four on the right)
along with the Volume Down key (the one nearest the front).
Release all of these keys as soon as you hear
a short, high-pitched beep repeating slowly.
You'll hear eight of these beeps
and then the |product name| will shut down and reboot.

If it shuts down but doesn't reboot
then turn `The Power Switch`_ off and on.
If it still doesn't reboot, or if it didn't even shut down,
then press `The Reset Button`_.
