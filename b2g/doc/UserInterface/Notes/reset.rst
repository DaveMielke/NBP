Resetting the |product name|
----------------------------

If you ever need to reset the |product name|
then press Dots4568 (all four on the right)
along with the Volume Down key (the one nearest the front).
Release all of these keys as soon as you hear
a short, high-pitched beep repeating slowly.
You'll hear several of these beeps and then the |product name| will reboot.
