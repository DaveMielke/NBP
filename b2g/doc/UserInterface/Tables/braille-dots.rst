A standard braille cell consists of six dots arranged in three rows and two
columns. Each dot can be specifically identified by its number as follows:

.. table:: The Standard Six-dot Braille Cell

  ===  ============  ===  ======  ====
  Dot  Position      Row  Column  Cell
  ---  ------------  ---  ------  ----
  1    top-left      1    1       ⠁
  2    middle-left   2    1       ⠂
  3    bottom-left   3    1       ⠄
  4    top-right     1    2       ⠈
  5    middle-right  2    2       ⠐
  6    bottom-right  3    2       ⠠
  ===  ============  ===  ======  ====

Computer braille has introduced two more dots in a fourth row at the bottom.

.. table:: Additional Dots in Computer Braille

  ===  ============  ===  ======  ====
  Dot  Position      Row  Column  Cell
  ---  ------------  ---  ------  ----
  7    below-left    4    1       ⡀
  8    below-right   4    2       ⢀
  ===  ============  ===  ======  ====

A picture may make this numbering convention easier to understand::

  1 o o 4
  2 o o 5
  3 o o 6
  7 o o 8
