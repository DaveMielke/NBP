Emulating the Android Keys
--------------------------

All Android devices have a number of special keys. There are two ways to
emulate each of them:

* With two hands, by pressing Space together with a related letter or
  special symbol. While these may be easier to remember, they're also less
  convenient because both hands must be removed from the display.

* With one hand, by pressing Dot4 together with one of the D-Pad keys.

Emulating Screen Gestures
-------------------------

To tap (or click) the current screen element, press Center. Another
(legacy) way to do it is to press `The Enter Key`_.

To hold (or long click) the current screen element, press Space+Center.
