Navigating with the Directional Keys
------------------------------------

Up moves up through the lines of text for the current screen 
element, and, when on the top line, moves to the start of the text for
the previous screen element.

Down moves down through the lines of text for the current screen 
element, and, when on the bottom line, moves to the start of the text for
the next screen element.

Left pans to the left through the text for the current screen 
element, wrapping to the end of the previous line, and, when at the start of 
the text, moves to the start of the text for the previous screen element.

Right pans to the right through the text for the current screen 
element, wrapping to the start of the next line, and, when at the end of 
the text, moves to the start of the text for the next screen element.

Space+Up performs a scroll backward (up or left) operation.

* If within a list then move up several elements.

* If within an input area then move up to the first line of the current
  paragraph. If already on the first line of a paragraph then move up to the
  first line of the previous paragraph.

etc.

Space+Right moves
