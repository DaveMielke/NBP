Dragging Screen Elements
------------------------

Some screens allow their elements to be moved around.
This, for example, is how most launchers allow users to reorganize their home screens
(see `Managing the Home Screen`_).

Moving a screen element to a new location is normally done
by dragging it with a finger or mouse.
The |user interface| supports a set of simple drag operations.

* Holding Dot5 while pressing one of the four edges of the directional pad
  drags the current screen element one position in the intended direction.

* Holding Dot5 while pressing Center initiates a drag
  of the current screen element to an unrelated location.
  To complete the drag, navigate to the screen element that's nearest
  to the new location, and then hold Dot6 while pressing
  one of the five keys on the directional pad:

  Left
    Drag it to the immediate left of the new screen element.

  Right
    Drag it to the immediate right of the new screen element.

  Up
    Drag it to immediately above the new screen element.

  Down
    Drag it to immediately below the new screen element.

  Center
    Drag it on top of the new screen element.
