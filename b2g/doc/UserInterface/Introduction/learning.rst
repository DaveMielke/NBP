Ways to Learn
-------------

There are a number of ways to learn about the |user interface|
right on the |product name| itself:

Pressing Space+h (dots 125)
  This brings up an on-device copy of this document so you can read it off-line.
  It's a plain text version, though, so even internal links won't work.

Pressing Space+Dots78+h (dots 125)
  This brings up a web-resident copy of this document.
  It's an HTML version so all links (both internal and external) will work.
  There are, however, two potential problems with this method:

  * |uses internet|

  * Not all web browsers present web pages in an accessible way.
    As of the time that this is being written, it seems that
    |recommended web browser| may be the only one that does.
    If the |user interface| tells you that there's a "web view"
    where you're expecting to find the content of a web page
    then you're using a non-accessible browser.

Using an `Action Chooser`_
  Pressing Space+Dot8+h (dots 125)
    This brings up an action chooser that lists all of the actions
    that don't need a cursor routing key.

  Holding Space while pressing a cursor routing key
    This brings up an action chooser that lists all of the actions
    that need a cursor routing key.

  Each line shows the name of an action,
  followed by the key combination that invokes it.
  You can also immediately invoke an action from within the chooser
  by pressing Center while on its line.
