Ways to Learn
-------------

There are a number of ways to learn about the |user interface|
right on the |product name| itself:

Pressing Space+h (dots 125)
  This brings up an on-device copy of this document so you can read it off-line.
  It's a plain text version, though, so even internal links won't work.

Pressing Space+Dot7+h (dots 125)
  This brings up a web-resident copy of this document.
  It's an HTML version so all links (both internal and external) will work.
  There are, however, two potential problems with this method:

  * |uses internet|

  * Not all web browsers present web pages in an accessible way.
    As of the time that this is being written, it seems that
    |recommended web browser| may be the only one that does.
    If the |user interface| tells you that there's a "web view"
    where you're expecting to find the content of a web page
    then you're using a non-accessible browser.

Pressing Space+Dot8+h (dots 125)
  This brings up an `Action Chooser`_ that lists all of the top-level actions
  that you can do. Each line shows the name of an action followed by the
  key combination that invokes it. You can also invoke an action immediately
  by pressing Enter while you're on its line in the chooser.
