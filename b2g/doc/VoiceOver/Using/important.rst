Important Bindings
------------------

The two most important bindings to know are those that let you switch
the |product name| to its remote braille display and back to Android.
They are:

Space + Dots78
  Switch to the remote braille display.

VolumeDown + VolumeUp
  Switch back to Android.

When switched to the remote braille display,
all of the keys except for the volume keys and the power switch
belong to, and are controlled by, the remote braille display.
That's why the binding to switch back to Android is a little unusual.

The remote braille display keeps running in the background,
and, therefore, is always fully up-to-date,
while the |product name| is switched to Android.

Operating Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remote braille display has two operating modes: Navigation and Keyboard.
You can switch between them as follows:

Forward + Space
  Switch to Keyboard Mode.

Backward + Space
  Switch to Navigation Mode.

.. _Navigation:

Navigation Mode is for reading the screen
without accidentally typing anything.
Since the eight dot keys aren't used for input,
they're used to perform a rich set of screen navigation actions.
This mode supports both the `common bindings`_ and the `device-specific bindings`_.
It's the mode that the remote braille display starts in.

.. _Keyboard:

Keyboard Mode enables you to type, and, therefore,
provides somewhat less navigation capability.
Any combination of the eight dot keys, as well as Space by itself,
type input in the expected way.
This mode only supports the `common bindings`_.
In general, though, you can still use any Navigation Mode binding
by adding Space to it.

Single-key Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The individual keys perform common navigation functions.
These bindings work in both Navigation and Keyboard mode, except that,
when in Keyboard mode, the dot keys must be combined with Space.
