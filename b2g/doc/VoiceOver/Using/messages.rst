The remote braille display may show one of these special messages:

remote display off
  This means that the remote braille display hasn't been turned on yet.
  See `Turn Remote Display On`_.

Bluetooth off
  This means that the remote braille display is on but that Bluetooth isn't.
  See `Turn Bluetooth on`_.

Bluetooth waiting
  This means that the remote braille display is waiting
  for a host to connect to it.
  This may mean that your |apple device| has gone to sleep as
  |voice over| drops its connection to the braille display when that happens.
