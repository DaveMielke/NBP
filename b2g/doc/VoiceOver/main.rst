Getting Started
===============

Check the |os name| Release
---------------------------

Your |apple device| needs to be running
at least release |os release| of |os name|.
To verify this:

1) Tap on ``Settings``.
2) Tap on ``General``.
3) Tap on ``Software Update``.

This screen will tell you which release of |os name|
your |apple device| is currently running.
If a new release is available then
it'll include a brief description of that new release.
If you'd like to upgrade then tap on ``Download and Install``.

If your |apple device| is already running |os name| |os release| (or later)
then you may wish to finish configuring it for use with your |product name|
before upgrading it to a newer |os name| release.
