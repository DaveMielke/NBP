Initial Setup
=============

There are a few things that you'll need to do
before you'll be able to use your |product name|
as a remote braille display for your |apple device|.
Both devices need to be made aware of each other,
and then |voice over| needs to be told to interact with your |product name|.
While this may sound a bit complicated, it's actually fairly easy.
Here's what you need to do.

Check the |os name| Release
---------------------------

Your |apple device| needs to be running
at least release |os release| of |os name|.
To verify this:

1) Tap on ``Settings``.
2) Tap on ``General``.
3) Tap on ``Software Update``.

This screen will tell you which release of |os name|
your |apple device| is currently running.
If a new release is available then
it'll include a brief description of that new release.
If you'd like to upgrade then tap on ``Download and Install``.

If your |apple device| is already running |os name| |os release| (or later)
then you may wish to finish configuring it for use with your |product name|
before upgrading it to a newer |os name| release.

Turn Remote Display On
----------------------

The ``Remote Display`` feature of your |product name| needs to be enabled.
To do this:

1) Press Space+o (dots 135) to go to the ``Options`` screen.
2) Repeatedly press Space+Dot4 to go down to the ``Remote Display`` setting.
3) Press Space+Dot6 to go right to the checkbox.
4) If the box isn't checked then press Center.

Turn Bluetooth On
-----------------

Your |apple device| and |product name| communicate via Bluetooth.
You need to ensure, therefore, that Bluetooth is turned on on your |product name|.
To do this:

1) Press Space+s (dots 234), and then b (dots 12),
   to go to the Bluetooth Settings screen.
   If you don't press the b soon enough then navigate down to
   ``Bluetooth Settings`` and press Center.

2) At the top of the ``Bluetooth Settings`` screen is an on/off checkbox.
   If it's not checked then press Center.

Stay on this screen for the next step.

Make the |product name| Visible
-------------------------------

Your |product name| will need to be **visible**
(also known as **discoverable**)
in order for your |apple device| to find it.
To do this:

1) Go to the ``Bluetooth Settings`` screen
   (as described above in `Turn Bluetooth On`_).

2) Find the line that describes how ``visible`` your |product name| currently is.
   It'll say something like one of the following:

   * Only visible to paired devices
   * Visible to all nearby Bluetooth devices

Since your |product name| and |apple device| haven't been paired yet,
you'll need your |product name|, at least for the time being,
to be visible to all nearby devices.
Press Center until this is what that line says.
As always, you can always change this to a more secure setting later.

Now you'll need to make sure that your |product name| actually is visible.
To do this:

1) Navigate up to ``More Options`` and press Center.

2) Navigate to ``Visibility Timeout`` and press Center.

This screen contains a set of radio buttons.
Each of them (except for the last one)
specifies some number of minutes or hours.
This is for how long you'd like your |product name| to remain visible.
The last radio button is ``Never Time Out``,
which means that your |product name| will remain visible
until you change this setting to something else.

When you go to this screen,
the radio button for the current setting will be pressed.
If you'd like to change the setting then navigate to
its corresponding radio button and press Center.

Our recommendation is that you set the visibility timeout to one hour.
This will give you plenty of time to configure |voice over|
before your |product name| automatically becomes invisible again.

You might consider setting your |product name| to remain visible,
but we recommend against this for the following reasons:

* The battery drains faster while the |product name| is visible.

* It's less secure when your |product name| is visible because
  anyone else with a Bluetooth device will be able to detect
  whenever you're near by.

Pair from within |voice over|
-----------------------------

Your |product name| must be paired with your |apple device|
from within |voice over|.
Initiating the pairing
either from the |product name| or from the |os name| Bluetooth screen
won't work.

To pair your |product name| with your |apple device|:

1) Tap on ``Settings``.
2) Tap on ``General``.
3) Tap on ``Accessibility``.
4) Tap on ``VoiceOver``.
5) Tap on ``Braille``.
6) Find ``Choose a Braille Display``.

Just below this line,
you'll find a list of the braille displays that |voice over| can see.
For each of them, it'll tell you if it's
``not paired``, ``paired``, ``selected``, or ``connected``.

Find the line for your |product name|, and tap it.
|voice over| will tell you that it's pairing with your |product name|,
and then, a few seconds later, it'll tell you
that your |product name| is ``selected`` and ``connected``.

That's it! You're all done!
You're now able to use your |product name| as a remote braille display
for your |apple device|.
