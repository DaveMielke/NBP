1.  Dot8+c (dots 148)Copy all of the text to the clipboard.
I don't think we should have commands without space bar. Add a space and
I'd be happy.

2. We should define the word Field in the context of the screen.

3. Under Hardware Alerts, describe the context of what is happening.  Like
starting the Hardware from a power off state.

4.  I find myself wishing there was another column in your key definition
tables like screen operations.  This new column would be the old chord
notation if one exists.  For example S1356 would have n-chord or chord-z.
The mental effort to translate S1356 into space plus Z is considerable.
The column would be blank in some cases where a chord is difficult to
define.  Your notation is very precise but difficult to read. Both would be
nice.

5.  In the legacy actions, what is W in one hand mode on?  I found myself
scrolling back to the table that defines symbols.  The added column could
help with this.

6.  The internal flash memory is 8.5GB not 1.5GB

7.  The internal SD card is not used in rev C.  It was removed and replaced
with the internal 8GB flash memory also called emmc flash.
