Additional Common Symbols
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The representations of these additional symbols have been designed such that
they can be relatively easily remembered. The following methods have been used:

* Adding dot 8 to a related letter, e.g. adding dot 8 to the letter ``c`` for
  the copyright sign.

* Adding dot 7 to a related punctuation symbol, e.g. adding dot 7 to the dollar
  sign for the cent sign.

* The superscript digits are rendered by adding dot 7 to the representation of
  the corresponding regular digit.

* The subscript digits are rendered by adding dot 8 to the representation of
  the corresponding regular digit.
