Recovery Mode is a single-user environment within which system 
maintenance can be performed safely. The |user interface| isn't available in 
Recovery Mode. Braille access in Recovery Mode is provided by BRLTTY
(see |BRLTTY home page URL|).

BRLTTY's key bindings for the |product name| are different than those 
defined by the |user interface|. Describing them is beyond the scope of 
this document. Please see |BRLTTY key table URL|.

Android's visual 
Recovery Mode menu can still be used, though braille must first be disabled. Those who prefer to use an external 
video monitor must press both volume keys together (VolumeDown + 
VolumeUp) in order to stop BRLTTY's |product name| braille driver. The 
|product name| keyboard can then be used to navigate the visual menu.
